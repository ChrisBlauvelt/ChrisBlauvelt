            <div itemprop='description'>Hello! I'm Chris - The TechieNeighbor. I have worked for many business around the Metro-Atlanta area throughout my career: from my last position at a large Managed Service Provider - acting as the Internal IT and Systems Administrator for a wide variety of systems. My background prior to IT was in the customer service and hospitality fields, and I have a major in Philosophy from Appalachian State University.

I hope to be able to help solve whatever problems you may need assistance with! </div>
