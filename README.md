Hi, Iâ€™m @ChrisBlauvelt a.k.a. The TechieNeighbor
Iâ€™m digging infrastructure as code, anything to do with Linux, and System Administration!
Iâ€™m always learning something new, and exploring new projects, but I love NixOS, and am attempting to brush up on all of my code language-base to be more versatile in implementations. 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that I can assist with, and anything to do with Linux, automation, containerization, Infrastructure-as-code, podcasting, music, and microcontrollers!
